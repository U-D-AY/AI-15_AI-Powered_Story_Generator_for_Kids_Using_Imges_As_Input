# AI-Powered Story Generator for Kids Using Images as Input

## Project Overview

### Title

AI-Powered Story Generator for Kids Using Images as Input

### Problem Statement

Creating personalized and engaging stories for kids can be time-intensive. This project addresses the need for an AI-powered tool that generates imaginative and age-appropriate stories based on input images, making storytelling fun and interactive.

### Objectives and Goals

- Generate creative, coherent, and engaging stories using NLP models.
- Ensure the stories are tailored for kids aged 5–12 with simple vocabulary and fun tones.

### Key Features

- Accepts single or multiple images as input.
- Generates short stories (200–500 words) incorporating image elements.
- Interactive and visually enriched stories (optional).
- Age-appropriate language and optional moral lessons.

### Target Audience

Parents, educators, caregivers, and developers of educational tools.
